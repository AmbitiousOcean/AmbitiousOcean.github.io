I am a Robotics M.Sc. student at EPFL, with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in robot learning—especially reinforcement learning, vision-language(-action) models, and the interplay between perception, control, and real-world deployment.

I have a strong foundation in mathematics and physics, and I also bring extensive hands-on engineering experience. I enjoy translating theoretical ideas into working systems, making the robot performs reliably under real-world constraints.
